# credit-card

In a file called credit.c write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format. 

For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card). 

But do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int! 

To test:

gcc credit.c cs50.c && ./a.out
